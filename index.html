    <h4>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>Rinse snappers well with water.<br />
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>On a cutting board, create 3 deep slits on both
      sides of the snappers.<br />
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>Place snappers in a bowl as you go.<br />
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>When done, we are going to season.<br />
      Pour lime juice, garlic, pepper, salt, oregano, onion powder and adobo
      over the fish and mix in well into the fish.<br />
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours but
      overnight would be preferred. I have even seasoned for 36 hours. The
      flavors get super into the fish. Yum!<br />
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>When ready to make, use the largest non-stick
      frying pan you have. Add enough oil to cover at least 1-1/2 inches of
      depth. <strong>Step 7:</strong>Heat the skillet for a few minutes over
      medium heat. In the meantime, dredge the snapper.<br />
      <strong>Step 8:</strong>Dredge in flour and make sure to get flour into
      those crevices so they are also nice and crispy.<br />
      <strong>Step 9:</strong>Fry for a few minutes on the first side but do not
      turn until it is ready. Just check by lifting a little to make sure the
      snapper is golden. That is a sign, especially at medium heat that is is
      ready to be turned over.<br />
      <strong>Step 10:</strong>Once you turn over, dredge the cooked side with
      the oil a couple of times to make sure the top stays nice and hot.<br />
      <strong>Step 11:</strong>Total time should be no longer than 15 minutes
      for frying. But of course, not all stoves are the same so keep an eye on
      it the entire time.<br />
      <strong>Step 12:</strong>Serve with your favorite sides.

      Step 1: Make shells: Mix flour, sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium
      bowl. Cut in shortening until crumbly.<br />
      Step 2: Make a well in the center and add Marsala wine, water, vinegar,
      egg, and egg yolk.<br />
      Step 3: Mix with a fork until the dough becomes stiff, then finish
      kneading it by hand on a clean surface, adding a bit more water if needed
      for about 10 minutes. <br />Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1
      to 2 hours.<br />
      Step 4: Divide cannoli dough into three balls; flatten each one just
      enough to get through the pasta machine. Roll a ball of dough through
      successively thinner settings until you have reached the thinnest setting.
      Dust lightly with flour if necessary.<br />
      Step 5: Place the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a
      cutter or large glass, cut out 4 to 5-inch circles.<br />
      Step 6: Dust the circles with a light coating of flour. This will help you
      later in removing the shells from the tubes. Roll dough around cannoli
      tubes, sealing the edge with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining
      dough balls.<br />
      Step 7: Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190
      degrees C).<br />
      Step 8: Fry shells on the tubes in hot oil, a few at a time, until golden,
      about 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to turn as needed. Remove shells carefully
      using tongs, and place them on a cooling rack set over paper towels.<br />
      Step 9: Cool just long enough that you can handle the tubes, then
      carefully twist the tube to remove the shell. Using a tea towel may help
      you get a better grip. Wash or wipe off the tubes, and use them for more
      shells. <br />Cooled shells can be placed in an airtight container and
      kept for up to 2 months. You should only fill them immediately or up to 1
      hour before serving.<br />
      Step 10: Make filling: Mix ricotta cheese and confectioners' sugar
      together in a large bowl until well combined. Fold in chocolate and lemon
      zest.<br />
      Step 11:Transfer mixture into a pastry bag and pipe into shells, filling
      from the center to one end, then doing the same from the other side. Dust
      with additional confectioners' sugar to serve, if you like.<br/>
